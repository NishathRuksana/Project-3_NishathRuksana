**Calgary Permits Explorer**

This is an interactive web application that allows users to explore building permits in Calgary. The map displays building permit data, which can be filtered by date range for a more focused view. The application uses Leaflet.js and MarkerCluster to visualize permit locations, providing a detailed popup with permit information when clicked.

**Features**

- Interactive Map: View building permits as markers on an interactive map of Calgary.
- Date Filter: Filter permits by start and end date to narrow down the results.
- Marker Clustering: Group permits into clusters for easier navigation and a cleaner map interface.

- Reset Function: Clear the date filter and remove any displayed permit data.
